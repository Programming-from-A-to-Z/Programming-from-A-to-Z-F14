Programming-from-A-to-Z-F14
===========================

This course focuses on programming strategies and techniques behind procedural analysis and generation of text-based data. We'll explore topics ranging from evaluating text according to its statistical properties to the automated production of text with probabilistic methods to text visualization. Students will learn server-side and client-side JavaScript programming and develop projects that can be shared and interacted with online.  There will be weekly homework assignments as well as a final project.

## Week 1
### Course intro / expectations
* Where to find course materials
* Overview / syllabus
* Homework / final project
* Attendance / participation

### [Week 1 Notes](http://shiffman.net/teaching/a2z/week1/)
* Basic JavaScript
* p5.js
* Strings in JS
* Simple Text Analysis
   * client-side
   * server-side

### Assignment
* [Sign up for the class google group](https://groups.google.com/a/nyu.edu/forum/#!forum/a2z-group/)
* Develop a program that "writes" or "reads" (or both) text, i.e. generate your own text from a source text (or via some other generative method) or create your own method for analyzing the statistical properties (or, dare I say, meaning) of an input text.  You can use node to process a text file or you can get user input in a browser.  Feel free to play around with visual ideas for displaying text with p5.js.
