# Programming from A to Z, Spring 2014

This course focuses on programming strategies and techniques behind procedural analysis and generation of text-based data. We'll explore topics ranging from evaluating text according to its statistical properties to the automated production of text with probabilistic methods to text visualization. Students will learn server-side and client-side JavaScript programming and develop projects that can be shared and interacted with online.  There will be weekly homework assignments as well as a final project.

* [Strings in JavaScript](http://shiffman.net/teaching/a2z/week1/#strings)
* [File I/0 with Node](http://shiffman.net/teaching/a2z/week1/#file)
* [Simple Text Analysis](http://shiffman.net/teaching/a2z/week1/#analysis)
* [Back to p5.js, processing text from a user](http://shiffman.net/teaching/a2z/week1/#p5analysis)

### Examples
* [Processing to p5](https://github.com/shiffman/Programming-from-A-to-Z-F14/tree/master/week1/00_Processing_to_p5.js)
* [OOP in JS](https://github.com/shiffman/Programming-from-A-to-Z-F14/tree/master/week1/01_objects_in_JS)
* [DOM manipulation in p5](https://github.com/shiffman/Programming-from-A-to-Z-F14/tree/master/week1/02_DOM_p5)

* [Process user text in p5](https://github.com/shiffman/Programming-from-A-to-Z-F14/tree/master/week1/05_p5_text)

### Assignment
* [Sign up for the class google group](https://groups.google.com/a/nyu.edu/forum/#!forum/a2z-group/)
* [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGsQwAu3PzU) or [read](http://secretlifeofpronouns.com/book.php) The Secret Life of Pronouns.
* Develop a program that "writes" or "reads" (or both) text, i.e. generate your own text from a source text (or via some other generative method) or create your own method for analyzing the statistical properties (or, dare I say, meaning) of an input text.  You can use node to process a text file or you can get user input in a browser.  Feel free to play around with visual ideas for displaying text with p5.js.
