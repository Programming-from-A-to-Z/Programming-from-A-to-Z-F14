// In this example, we want to load a *large* (2MegaPixels)
// image and display it in setup().
//
// Since setup() happens quickly at the beginning, the image doesn't
// have time to properly load before setup() is done.
// 
// We are introducing preload() where you can run load
// operations that are guaranteed to complete by setup().
// This is called asynchronous loading, because it happens whenever
// the computer is done and ready, not necessarily when you call it.
