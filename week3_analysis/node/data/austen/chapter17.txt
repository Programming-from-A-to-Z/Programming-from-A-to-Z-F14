elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr wickham and herself jane listened with astonishment and concern she knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr bingley's regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham the possibility of his having endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings and nothing remained therefore to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either side very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody laugh as much as you choose but you will not laugh me out of my opinion my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr darcy to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for it is impossible no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him oh no i can much more easily believe mr bingley's being imposed on than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts everything mentioned without ceremony if it be not so let mr darcy contradict it besides there was truth in his looks it is difficult indeed it is distressing one does not know what to think i beg your pardon one knows exactly what to think but jane could think with certainty on only one point that mr bingley if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair became public the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking mr bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield which was fixed for the following tuesday the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation to the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding mrs bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the others they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennet's civilities the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family mrs bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself instead of a ceremonious card jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr wickham and of seeing a confirmation of everything in mr darcy's look and behaviour the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event or any particular person for though they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a ball and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enough i think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr bingley's invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dance i am by no means of the opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her elizabeth felt herself completely taken in she had fully proposed being engaged by mr wickham for those very dances and to have mr collins instead her liveliness had never been worse timed there was no help for it however mr wickham's happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little longer and mr collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more it now first struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to her elizabeth however did not choose to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply mr collins might never make the offer and till he did it was useless to quarrel about him if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once no aunt no officers no news could be sought after the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydia
