mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it it was then disclosed in the following manner observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes said her mother resentfully since we are not to visit but you forget mamma said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs long promised to introduce him i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing she has two nieces of her own she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of her no more have i said mr bennet and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters don't keep coughing so kitty for heaven's sake have a little compassion on my nerves you tear them to pieces kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them ill i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully when is your next ball to be lizzy to morrow fortnight aye so it is cried her mother and mrs long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr bingley to her impossible mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teasing i honour your circumspection a fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight but if we do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs long and her neices must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself the girls stared at their father mrs bennet said only nonsense nonsense what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation cried he do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense i cannot quite agree with you there what say you mary for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts mary wished to say something sensible but knew not how while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to mr bingley i am sick of mr bingley cried his wife i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me that before if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while how good it was in you my dear mr bennet but i knew i should persuade you at last i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance well how pleased i am and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now now kitty you may cough as much as you choose said mr bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was shut i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintances every day but for your sakes we would do anything lydia my love though you are the youngest i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball oh said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i am the youngest i'm the tallest the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr bennet's visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner
