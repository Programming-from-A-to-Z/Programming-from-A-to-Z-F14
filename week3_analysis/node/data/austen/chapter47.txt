i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel's family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is not adequate to the risk do you really think so cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment upon my word said mrs gardiner i begin to be of your uncle's opinion it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of i cannot think so very ill of wickham can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect i can believe him capable if indeed it should be so but i dare not hope it why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case in the first place replied mr gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland oh but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road well then supposing them to be in london they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptional purpose it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland but why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must their marriage be private oh no no this is not likely his most particular friend you see by jane's account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her wickham will never marry a woman without some money he cannot afford it and what claims has lydia what attraction has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well as to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father's behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so very ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt of whom does jane ever think ill and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would think capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating and do you really know all this cried mrs gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl yet he knew to the contrary himself he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her but does lydia know nothing of this can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand oh yes that that is the worst of all till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight's time as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head that such a consequence as this could ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other not the slightest i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had anything of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey from elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them a hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down from her mother's apartment immediately met her elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives not yet replied jane but now that my dear uncle is come i hope everything will be well is my father in town yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word and have you heard from him often we have heard only twice he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention and my mother how is she how are you all my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all she does not yet leave her dressing room mary and kitty thank heaven are quite well but you how are you cried elizabeth you look pale how much you must have gone through her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears when they were all in the drawing room the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce their marriage mrs bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes' conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villainous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage blaming everybody but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing if i had been able said she to carry my point in going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was overruled as i always am poor dear child and now here's mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain it is not quite a week since they left brighton in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done oh my dear brother replied mrs bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them after they are married and above all keep mr bennet from fighting tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frighted out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses oh brother how kind you are i know you will contrive it all but mr gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fear and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table they all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before one came from her books and the other from her toilette the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in this business had given more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and everything about it which i have not already heard give me further particulars what did colonel forster say had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place they must have seen them together for ever colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydia's side but nothing to give him any alarm i am so grieved for him his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry did he know of their intending to go off had colonel forster seen denny himself yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing anything of their plans and would not give his real opinion about it he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydia's last letter she had prepared her for such a step she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks but not before they went to brighton no i believe not and did colonel forster appear to think well of wickham himself does he know his real character i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened perhaps it would have been better replied her sister but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable we acted with the best intentions could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia's note to his wife he brought it with him for us to see jane then took it from her pocket book and gave it to elizabeth these were the contents my dear harriet you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning as soon as i am missed i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess with who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i love and he is an angel i should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off you need not send them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name 'lydia wickham ' what a good joke it will be i can hardly write for laughing pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him to night tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up good bye give my love to colonel forster i hope you will drink to our good journey your affectionate friend lydia bennet oh thoughtless thoughtless lydia cried elizabeth when she had finished it what a letter is this to be written at such a moment but at least it shows that she was serious on the subject of their journey whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a scheme of infamy my poor father how he must have felt it i never saw anyone so shocked he could not speak a word for full ten minutes my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion oh jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day i do not know i hope there was but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties your attendance upon her has been too much for you you do not look well oh that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on my aunt phillips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters' if they should be of use to us she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of one's neighbours assistance is impossible condolence insufferable let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham it had come with a fare from london and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at clapham if he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make inquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this
