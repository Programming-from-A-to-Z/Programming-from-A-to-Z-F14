kim / anita -
a volume of 7247 mm shows to have been allocated to the reliant 201 contract
for november . there was no nomination for reliant at this point in november
and , therefore , there should be no volume allocated to their contract .
please make sure these volumes are moved off the reliant contract prior to
november close .
thanks .
