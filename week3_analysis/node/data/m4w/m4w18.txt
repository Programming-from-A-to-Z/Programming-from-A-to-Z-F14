i'll try to make this short .  i sat next to you on the 5 train .  you bumped me with your arm and said sorry .  you then started asking me about the weather .  but you then realized you were on the wrong train and you just got off .  i wasn't sure if i should even bother asking for your number but if you see this .  which you most likely won't but hey what the hell .  would really like to go out with you sometime .
