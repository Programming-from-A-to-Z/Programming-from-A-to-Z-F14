sunday sept 14 6pm you were amazingly gorgeous .  and you were wearing uggs .  jeans .  and you had brown long hair .   you were on the line next to me placing your groceries on the counter .  you and i kept looking at one another .  but i didn't say anything to you silly me .  you were with your daughter and i had to go back in the store after i left to get something else .  i was soo hoping you would still be outside when i came back out  .  but you were gone .  .  .   i liked everything about you that i saw .  you are beautiful .  .  .  .  .  if this is you .  which i doubt you will ever see this .  but if you are her .  then tell me what i was wearing
