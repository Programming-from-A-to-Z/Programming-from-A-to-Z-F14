just saw you this morning .   you had gum on your shoe and were trying to scrape it off and we caught each others' eye and glanced away .   we did keep stealing glances on the train and we both got off at 34th st .   i thought i lost track of you but saw you again while i was grabbing coffee as you crossed 8th to w31st .    you are very cute and i hope you were able to get the gum off your shoe and if you see this .  i'd love to buy you a drink .
