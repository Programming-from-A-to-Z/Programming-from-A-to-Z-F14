this may be a long shot but i could not stop thinking about you ever since i've laid my eyes on you .   we sat next to each other on the bench at the dekalb subway station after 11 p . m .  last night .  we boarded the q train heading to coney island and we were holding onto the same pole .  you stumbled a bit right before you got off at your stop .  i was the black security guard standing right next to you with the messenger bag and holding a plastic bag .  you were white with dark brownbrunette hair with a feather accessory pinned to it and you were wearing glasses .  you were wearing a thin coat and a dressskirt with black leggings .  you had a bookbag which you had your phone in and you were reading a book .  i thought you were really beautiful and lovely .  i wanted to at least say hi to you but my shyness got the better of me .  plus .  i didn't know if you were seeing someone or not .    i hope this works and i really hope to hear back from you .  i would love to take you out for coffee or lunch and get to know you more .
