well here goes nothing .   your name is regina and you are taiwanese but born and raised in ny .   you were in a white dress and i bought you a bombay tonic .   you look mid 20s .   you were with 2 girlfriends one of them is taiwanese too and the other girl sounds like shes from china or something accent .   i regret not making more of an effort to talk to you cuz i really didn't know what to say .   i was kinda caught off guard as you are so incredibly hot in my eyes i was surprised you even let me buy you drink and i don't usually talk to girls that are not mutual friends .   i'm half taiwanese and we talked for abit before you went to the room in front .   saw you again in the room in front for abit before i got too turned up and then i lost sight of you .   ive been going back to the rub ever since and i havent seen you so i thought i give it a shot over here .   if this sounds familiar to you please email me i would very much like to take you out for dinner sometime and get to know you better .   friends of regina who think it might be her please help me ask her about this i will be eternally grateful to you and give you a big reward .  .
