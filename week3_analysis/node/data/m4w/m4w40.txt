our eyes met listening to a saxophone at the 14th street station .  you got on the same train car i did .  i was reading a magazine in my green flannel and jeans .  and you asked if the train was going to washington .    square park .   yes .    it was .    1 more stop .    as you stepped off the train .  i told you my name .  yours is marielle .  i watched your red hat disappear up the steps .  and wished i'd stepped off with you and said more .    if you find this .  i hope you'll write .
