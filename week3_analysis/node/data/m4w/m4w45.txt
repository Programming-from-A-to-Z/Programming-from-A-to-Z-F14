you were keepin it real but looked quite ravishing waiting impatiently on the line .  .  .  . camo belly shirt and tight shorts .  large hoop earnings .  .  .  .  you briefly looked my way .  rolled your eyes and mumbled incoherently about racist laws .   unpaid bills .  a deadbeat dad on trumped up charges and boy .   i tell ya it got my juices flowing .  .  .  .  .  . the q100 bus line is like the love boat for me .
