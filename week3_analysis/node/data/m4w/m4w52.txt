on monday night .  you .  the one with curly black hair .  were sitting at the restaurant bar .  you and friend 1 were joined by friend 2 .  then 1 left .  i was around the corner .  a couple seats away .  and you and i exchanged several glances .  while i wasn't eavesdropping .  i couldn't help but hear parts of your conversation .  and i just kept thinking .  i wish she were talking to me .   we looked and laughed as i stood to leave .  perhaps i should have approached .
