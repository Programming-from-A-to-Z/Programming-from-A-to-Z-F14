i got on the 45 train this morning around 810 at 42nd street .   you were sitting across from me reading the art of modern dance and had a black duffel bag with the words goodbye in different languages .  you had dark hair and a tattoo on your left arm .  we looked at each other a bunch of times and i got off at 86th street .  anyway .  i think you're really cute .    maybe we could grab a drink sometime .  looking forward to hearing from you .
