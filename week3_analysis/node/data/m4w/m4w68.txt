i think of you every single day .  i hold on to the great memories in hope that we have a future .   i know i have to change much in my life for us to have a chance but i pray that i get one more time to show you what you mean to me and how special you are .   i know actions speak louder than words .   i just want you to know i will never .  ever forget you .  and each day spent without you can never be fully enjoyed or appreciated .   love you always g
