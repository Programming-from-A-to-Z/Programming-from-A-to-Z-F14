thankfully i washed out all the chlorine from ouy of my eyes and have emerged and left the neighborhoods property .  i haven't returned .  not even to vandalize anything and yet i am haunted at the fact i have visited .  the whole hood still drops by for a swim except for me so why do i feel the chlorine in my eyes .  one day i will forget you forever .  i hope one day you'll fully at least say forget about me enough for the lil ones sake and allow me and lil one to grow as life intended as we are living life for us .  hopefully this birthday she and i can enjoy .  .  .
