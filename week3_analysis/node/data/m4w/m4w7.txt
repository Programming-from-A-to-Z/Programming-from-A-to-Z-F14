just a simple project i'm working on .  this is for anyone who has lostis losing a loved one or has advice to give for someone they love .  basically .  this is for anyone with a heart .  if you don't .  you can just click that x button up there .     think if you lost your mom .  .  . or your dad .  what would you want to ask them for guidance in the years yet to come .  what do you think they would want to say on the day you get married or the day you have your first child .  or maybe you would just like to know their favorite moments with you as a child so you can share those stories with your kids .    maybe you have a child getting married and you'd like to give them advice .  but it's too hard to say what you need .  maybe you never had a relationship with a parent or child the way you wish you had .  but you feel it's too late to start over .     _____________________________________________________________________ don't leave questions unanswered .  .  .  what would you want them to know .  what would you say to them .   what advice would you give .   what questions would you want answered .  what memories would you want shared .  _____________________________________________________________________ email me with your questions .  thoughts .  comments .   remain anonymous if you'd like .   and say something funny .  cause this is so damn serious .    thanks .
