our love was real .  yet she doubted it .  she was sweet and caring .  yet she acted poorly when angry .  she was the best thing in my life .  yet she was also the worst .  she brought the best out of me .  yet ugliness too .  she looked in my eyes when we made love .  yet she was embarrassed after .  she is my one true love yet she cheated on me .  i can't forgive .  yet i long for her still .
