about 930 this morning .  i couldn't help but notice you on the penn station 34th street platform for the downtown e .  i tried to be a gentleman and not stare .  but it was almost impossible .  you had silky shoulder length hair and piercing green eyes .  you had a beautiful red dress and sexy ankle boots on .  you're stunning .  we boarded the train together but again i tried to be a gentleman and not approach you .  i'm sure you get unlimited attention and didn't want to impose you got off at spring street and told me to have a nice day .  thanks to that little comment i'll have a great week .  it's not often an old dog like me gets noticed by a knockout such as yourself .  i regret not speaking to you .  if you have interest in getting to know each other .  tell me what i helped you with before you got off the train .  if not .  i thank you for making my day .
