i'm pretty sure we were making eye contact at the end of the ride .  there .  .  . you even turned to look at me as you got off at 34th street .   at least i think it was 34th street .  .  . i was a bit taken with you .  and somewhat distracted .   you were sitting .  i was standing in front of you and a little to your right .   i wore sunglasses .  a jean shirt .  and looked a li'l bit scruffy .   anyway .  figured this was worth a shot in the dark .
