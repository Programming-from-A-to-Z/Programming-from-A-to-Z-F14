once upon a midnight dearie i woke with something in my head i couldn't escape the memory of a phone call and of what you said like a game show contestant with a parting gift i could not believe my eyes when i saw through the voice of a trusted friend who needs to humor me and tell me lies yeah humor me and tell me lies and i'll lie too and say i don't mind and as we seek so shall we find and when you're feeling open i'll still be here but not without a certain degree of fear of what will be with you and me i still can see things hopefully but you why you want to give me a runaround is it a surefire way to speed things up when all it does is slow me down and shake me and my confidence about a great many things but i've been there i can see it cower like a nervous magician waiting in the wings of a bad play where the heroes are right and nobody thinks or expects too much and hollywood's calling for the movie rights singing hey babe let's keep in touch hey baby let's keep in touch but i want more than a touch i want you to reach me and show me all the things no one else can see so what you feel becomes mine as well and soon if we're lucky we'd be unable to tell what's yours and mine the fishing's fine and it doesn't have to rhyme so don't you feed me a line but you why you want to give me a runaround is it a surefire way to speed things up when all it does is slow me down tra la la la la bombardier this is the pilot speaking and i've got some news for you it seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop and there ain't a whole lot that you can do oh sure the banner may be torn and the wind's gotten colder perhaps i've grown a little cynical but i know no matter what the waitress brings i shall drink in and always be full my cup shall always be full oh i like coffee and i like tea i'd like to be able to enter a final plea i still got this dream that you just can't shake i love you to the point you can no longer take well all right okay so be that way i hope and pray that there's something left to say but you why you want to give me a runaround is it a surefire way to speed things up when all it does is slow me down but you why you want to give me a runaround is it a surefire way to speed things up when all it does is slow me down
