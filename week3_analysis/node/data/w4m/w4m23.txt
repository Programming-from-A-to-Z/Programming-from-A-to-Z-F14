hey .  .  . oooh .  .  .  sheets of empty canvas .  untouched sheets of clay .  were laid spread out before me as her body once did all five horizons revolved around her soul as the earth to the sun now the air i tasted and breathed has taken a turn ooh .  and all i taught her was everything ooh .  i know she gave me all that she wore and now my bitter hands shade beneath the clouds of what was everything .  oh .  the pictures seared all been washed in black .  tattooed everything .  .  .   i take a walk outside i'm surrounded by some kids at play i can feel their laughter .  so why do i sear .  and twisted thoughts that spin round my head i'm spinning .  oh .  i'm spinning how quick the sun can .  drop away and now my bitter hands cradle broken glass of what was everything all the pictures seared all been washed in black .  tattooed everything .  .  .   all the love gone bad turned my world to black tattooed all i see .  all that i am .  all i'll be .  .  . yeah uh huh .  .  . uh huh .  .  . ooh .  .  .  i know someday you'll have a beautiful life .  i know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky .  but why why .  why can't it be .  why can't it be mine
