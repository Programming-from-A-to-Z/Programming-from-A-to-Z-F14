you were outside for a smoke .  i was on my way home .  you were really cute and i should've actually stayed to chat .  but instead i just answered your quick question as i passed .  it was outside a hotel .  so i'm not sure if you're just in town for a few days or you were just grabbing drinks at the bar .  but either way .  i'd like to continue that conversation .   tell me anything the hotel .  where on 44th you were .  what time it was .  any defining characteristics about me what i was wearing .  etc .   and the first drink is on me .
