you were a tall .  thin man with blond hair tied into a bun .  wearing a blue shirt .  talking to a male friend around 7 pm .   i was wearing a black lace dress and have light brown curly hair .   we got off the train at the same stop .  and of course i had nothing to say .  but damn did i think you were incredibly handsome .   if you noticed me and are interested .  don't be as shy as i was .
