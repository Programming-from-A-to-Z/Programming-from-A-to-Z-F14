tm .   when you first ran away in your avalance .  i did not know the reasons why .  and when i found out the truth .  it hurt me to the core .  i was scapegoated out to be something we both know was not true .   it toook lots of painful tears and time to finally clear my name .   this is my forgiving you .  my thanking you for making me understand i am so much better to myself for realizing my worth .   i just hope you treat whomever you end up with gets all the things you couldn't give me for the time we were together .   i will remember when you said you were falling for me and will nnot take it back .
