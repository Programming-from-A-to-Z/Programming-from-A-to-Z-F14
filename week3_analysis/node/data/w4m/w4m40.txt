anais nin love never dies a natural death .  it dies because we don't know how to replenish its source .  it dies of blindness and errors and betrayals .  it dies of illness and wounds it dies of weariness .  of witherings .  of tarnishings .   despite all thatmy love does not die .  nor does it weaken .  .  .  .  .  .  .   the beatles who knows how long i've loved you .  you know i love you still .  will i wait a lonely lifetime .  if you want me to i will .
