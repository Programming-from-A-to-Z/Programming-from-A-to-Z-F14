we dated about 2 months ago .  and then you just kinda faded away .  i never really figured out what went wrong .  for what is worth .  you have a special place in my heart .       saw you again in greenley square on 34th  .  you were there eating lunch by yourself .  a part of me wonders if you were there hoping to run into me .  since i know you don't work in this area and i told you i eat lunch there everyday .  i panicked and turned away when i saw you .  bc i wouldn't know what to say .       now that i gave it some thoughts .  i just want to tell you that i miss you .  .
