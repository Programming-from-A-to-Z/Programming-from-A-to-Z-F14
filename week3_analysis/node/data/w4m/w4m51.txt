we both tried to enter the nr subway station at canal street .   we both simultaneously realized the station was closed .   we laughed and continued our adventure together west .  working our way to the ace station and exchanged names .  work life .  night plans .  .  . but not numbers .   what you don't know is that i had just seen my ex pass through the little italy carnival .  holding hands with his new girlfriend .   what you don't know is i think you have a great smile .   what you don't know is i secretly waited for you to decide you'd rather go uptown with me than downtown .   a girl can dream .  right .   you brightened my night .   thank you .
