we saw each other twice today while running the loop in opposite directions .   you were wearing a grey tshirt and black shorts .   i was the blonde .   you were definitely checking me out each time we passed each other .   i was looking back .  but maybe hard to tell with my sunglasses .   if you see this shoot me a message and let me know what color shoes you were wearing .  so i know it's you .   it would be nice to see you again .
