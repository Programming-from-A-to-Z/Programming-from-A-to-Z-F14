i never do this .  but i saw you on the downtown f in a crowded train car on my way to work on saturday and am still thinking about you .  i got on at w 4th and got off at 2nd ave .  it was around 400430 pm me medium brown braided hair .  brown eyes behind glasses .  and an open blue shirt over a black dress .   you were are tall and handsome .  with light browndark blonde hair .    i was looking down and when i looked up i met your gaze for several seconds .  i looked away for a second and when i glanced back we met eyes again .  i'd be lying if i said my heart didn't skip a beat .   i don't know if you'll see this and i feel silly .  but for some reason i was so compelled to do so .
