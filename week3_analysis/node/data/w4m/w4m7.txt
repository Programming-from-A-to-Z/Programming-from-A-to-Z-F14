you were tall .  dark .  and slender with black .  curly hair clearly a professional .  i was sitting at the opposite side of the n train car .  you stood up .  it was your stop .  around atlantic ave maybe .  and our eyes immediately met .  you turned away .  and i did too .  but like magnets .  our eyes drew back towards each other .  you left the car and walked away .  the train moved .  and our gaze met once more .  i laughed .  it was funny .   red lipstick .  green jacket .  blue yoga mat .
