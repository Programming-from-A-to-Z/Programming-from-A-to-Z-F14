i have never felt such an inexplicable reaction upon seeing a stranger before .  you felt close but very far .  like a family member from a previous life .   you're young but have silvery hair .  tall and skinny with a prominent nose .  you wore a grey shirt and dark denim .   we stood next to each other and held on to the same pole .  i was wearing a white floral print blouse and a black floral print backpack .  when we first got on the subway from times square at around 630 .  a large white man got on as well and began a loud conversation with a black couple next to him .   maybe we will cross paths again .  but if not .  i just wanted to share my odd experience .  if you see this .  let me know what two items you were holding at the time .
