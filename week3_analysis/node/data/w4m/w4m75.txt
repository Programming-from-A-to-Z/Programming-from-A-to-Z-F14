we smiled at each other a few times and i would have liked to talk to you .  but lost you at the set break and then my friend wanted to leave .   you had blond hair a plaid shirt and we were dancing next to each other for awhile .  but rubbing up against someone it's too loud to have a conversation with isn't my style and it was too loud for conversation would like to talk promise i'm not as lame as posting on here implies .   this is definitely the lamest thing i've done all day .  maybe in two days
