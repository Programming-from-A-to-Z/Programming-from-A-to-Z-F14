i saw you early last week on the uptown 6 train .  a little after 8pm .  i sat down on the train across from you at spring street and commented on your nice cole haan shoes brown brogues with orange soles laces .    you have reddish blonde hair and a beard .  your black leather jacket and outfit really made the shoes stand out .  i thought i saw you smile at me when i got off the train at union square .  i'm an asianamerican girl with long hair and rainbow headphones .   i should have given you my phone number .  i hope that you see this .
