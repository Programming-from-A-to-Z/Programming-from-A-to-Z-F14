hey .  i saw you on the l train and you immediately looked at me when i walked in at grand street .  i didn't have the courage to talk to you but writing this missed connection was the first thing that came to mind .  you had a red snap back and a the hundreds shirt .  two full sleeves and i was creeping because i love artwork .  i saw one tattoo said loyalty on your right wrist .  we both took the 6 train up town at union square and i couldn't stop looking at you .  i was wearing a white crop top and a brown leather jacket .  i had black ray bans on my head and gold gladiators .  this took place around 940am .  let me know if you see this .
