i went to pianos last night knowing i shouldn't've .  but thankfully you had already left .  sometimes the memory of you kissing me under those seedy street lamps in the les still punctures my thoughts .  remember when you lightly touched my knee at that unbearably loud bar .  the ghost of it lingers on my left kneecap .  we hardly know each other but .  .  .  i think know you .  i think you know me .  .  .  somehow .  i'm not supposed to but i can't stop thinking about you .  i know you're happy where you are now and with the life you have now .  and i wish i felt the same .
