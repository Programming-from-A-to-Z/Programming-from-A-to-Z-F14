colonel fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at rosings it was some days however before they received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till easter day almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening for the last week they had seen very little of lady catherine or her daughter colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr darcy they had seen only at church the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine's drawing room her ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy much more than to any other person in the room colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them anything was a welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of mr darcy his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple to call out what is that you are saying fitzwilliam what is it you are talking of what are you telling miss bennet let me hear what it is we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid a reply of music then pray speak aloud it is of all subjects my delight i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste if i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficient and so would anne if her health had allowed her to apply i am confident that she would have performed delightfully how does georgiana get on darcy mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady catherine and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practice a good deal i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice she practises very constantly so much the better it cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though mrs collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the pianoforte in mrs jenkinson's room she would be in nobody's way you know in that part of the house mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding and made no answer when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument he drew a chair near her lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said you mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hear me i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others my courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me i shall not say you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear i am not afraid of you said he smilingly pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam i should like to know how he behaves among strangers you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner mr darcy you cannot deny the fact i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next my fingers wait your orders perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers shall we ask your cousin the reason of this said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to him it is because he will not give himself the trouble i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women's do they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i will not take the trouble of practising it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right you have employed your time much better no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting we neither of us perform to strangers here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of elizabeth immediately began playing again lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to anne's anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth's performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home
