happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs bingley and talked of mrs darcy may be guessed i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable well informed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydia's example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid from the further disadvantage of lydia's society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennet's being quite unable to sit alone mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished the letter was to this effect my dear lizzy i wish you joy if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to mr darcy about it if you had rather not yours etc as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought his affection for her soon sunk into indifference hers lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for elizabeth's sake he assisted him further in his profession lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingley's good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy's marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth pemberley was now georgiana's home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see they were able to love each other even as well as they intended georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way by elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end but at length by elizabeth's persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them
