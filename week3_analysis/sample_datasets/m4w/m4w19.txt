riding home about 930 last night .  you passed me coming up the hill with two full pannier bags and a baritone horn on your back .  confirming your hardcoreness .  we talked about how perfect the weather was for riding and how you just wanted to keep going .  i said you didn't have to go home .  you laughed a beautiful laugh then turned north on vanderbilt .  .  .
