the city is a big place .  and i'm only one guy in a million .  your rose colored hair was beauty to my eyes like being in a garden i'll pick you .  your green eyes amazed me like the auroras shinning so bright .  your softly spoken voice was music to my heart making it skip a beat to your alluring melody .  your beautiful radiant skin .  you're a rare beauty to behold .  your a rare should to find .  so many hearts in the world but only yours spoke to mines .  you melted my icy walls and warmed my flowing springs .  how i wish i can share this life time with you .  how i wish you was here with me .  how i miss you so much .  i just want you to know i love you .   it was only a moment in your presence but it seem like an eternity .  how i wish i could see you again .    lost please help me find .  green eyes red rose hair sweet pink lips radiant glowing skin you're to good to be real .   love is all i'm looking for now and i found it with you .   girl won't you be mine .
