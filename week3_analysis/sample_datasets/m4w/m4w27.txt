we were both waiting for the path at hoboken when i caught you looking at me .  i looked back .    when the train finally came .  we sat next to each other .    i immediately felt comfortable sitting next to you and felt like i could talk to you .  but i guess my consideration got the best of me because i didn't want to bother you in an enclosed area .    when you got off at christopher street .  you looked back at me almost as if to say well .  are you coming with me .   it might sound cheesy .  but when you looked at me i was just frozen looking back at you .    i wanted to get off the train and walk with you and tell you i thought you were beautiful .   i hope you see this .
