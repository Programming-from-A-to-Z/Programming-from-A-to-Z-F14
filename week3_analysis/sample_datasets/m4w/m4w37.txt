we met briefly i a tall .  dark haired guy .  and you a tall .  very cute .  red headed girl .   i got off the d train at 59 street to catch a local train .  you asked if the d was running local it wasn't .  so we waited a few minutes for the a train .  when it came .  you asked if i was sure it'd be running local .  and i promised you it was .  and that you could blame me if we both ended up at 125th st .  on the train we exchanged a few words .  and a few smiles until i got off at 81st st .   wish i had the chance to chat with you a bit longer .  perhaps you'll see this .  and grab a coffee with me sometime .
