you were an absolutely stunning woman .  mid to late 20s .  wonderful jaw structure and dirty blonde hair with piercing eyes .  ofcourse by the nyc standard we both had our headphones on .  and as i stepped on to the 1 train at christopher st we caught eachothers eye immediately .  at 14th .  we both switch to the 2 express .  and you got off at 72nd street .  .  .  i hate technology and headphones that prevent a random hello from being obnoxious .  .  .  you were in a grey jacket and white shirt with acid washed skinny jeans .  and i honestly feel like i just let something walk out of my life before it got started .  would love a random reconnection .  tell me what shoes you were wearing .  and let me sweep you off your feet .  .
