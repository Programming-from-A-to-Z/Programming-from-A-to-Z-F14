to the lady on the c train with me .  got off at the wrong stop 72 st .  and rode to 81st .  its was just before noon .  est .  time 1150 am .  damn i would love to adore you .  you were an elderly woman .  with great curves .  red hair .  glasses .  you look like a secret freak .  i had to restrain myself from becoming aggressive with you .  lord knows your body can handle it .  you were built for black men . we spoke briefly .  you told me you were tired and i replied its one of those days .  by looking at you i can tell you want me .  and i want you .  i wanted to take care of you .  invite you to my place .  play hooky from work .  and play all day while i served you tea for your cold .  i have my fingers crossed that you will see this .
