i sat down next to you .  you bumped me and apologized .  i said its alright .   you had long black hair and very pretty eyes .   i asked where you were going .  you said 168 or 188st .  that's when i realized i was about to go the wrong direction .  you told me where to go as i left .  and i thanked you .  you were beautiful .  and sweet .  never done this before .  but obviously i'm new to new york and this seemed like a thing to do in a city like this .
