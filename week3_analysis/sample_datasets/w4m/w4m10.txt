i feel strange posting about this .  but i feel it's necessary being that over the course of 2 years i've seen you multiple times and we always stare at eachother .   i saw you again tonight .  on myrtle ave .  by skips coffee in bushwick .  you have long hair that you tie back and a beard .  you're always wearing some quirky patterned outfit .  we looked at eachother .  and caught eyes because we know eachothers faces .  i should have said something but i froze .   i saw you a year and a half ago or maybe even 2 years ago now at benny's burritos in the east village .  you were sitting .  eating and drinking a margarita by yourself outside .  my friend and i were at a table next to you and i couldn't help but to keep looking over .  we kept making eye contact but never said a word to eachother .  even exchanged a few smiles .    i've seen you around brooklyn and manhattan walking multiple times .  it's really strange .  i have never seen a stranger as much as i see you .   i'm short and tonight was wearing a beanie and a large sweater if you do exist .  and you are not a figment of my imagination email me .  or if not .  perhaps i'll run into you again in a year .
