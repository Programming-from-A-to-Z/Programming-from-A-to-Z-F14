hey .  so i don't usually do this .  but here goes nothing .   you had a grey shirt and black hair this morning around 830 and you were standing right next to me from i think .  the lorimer l to union square .  i've got short blonde hair and was wearing a jean jacket with a blue scarf .  the only reason i'm doing this is because i felt this energy between the two of us that i don't come across often .  even though the only word you said to me was cheers while we were getting off the train .  .  . also i've had a few glasses of wine with a coworker and thought 'why not' .   so .  to prove you are this mystery man and not a total skeezeball tell me what the tattoo on your right bicep says and maybe we could grab a cup of coffee .
