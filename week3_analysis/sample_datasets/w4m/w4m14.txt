you are a tall young man with dark blonde hair .  and were wearing a red plaid shirt .  a grey jacket .  and brown leather shoes .  this was wednesday evening .  you were playing on your white phone .  i have brown hair with bangs .  and was wearing a denim jacket and black pants .  i passed you going into the subway at 23rd st .  you sat across from me on the train and we looked at each other .  you smiled but i think i looked away but i hope you saw me smile too .  we both got off at 14th and walked to the l .  and i was too shy to make eye contact again .  you got off at bedford and that was it .  i won't be so shy if we meet again .
