this was a few weeks ago but it was like 3 . 4 am and i was on the uptown 6 .  got on at union square with a couple of friends .  i was sitting across from you with one girlfriend and you asked us where we were coming from because we seemed to be in such a good mood .  we were coming from a rooftop in brooklyn and you said you had just come from the 13th step which made me laugh because that used to be my watering hole .  i didn't really think anything of it at first but you were actually really attractive and i think you said you were new to the city .  living in the ues .  i got off at grand central .
