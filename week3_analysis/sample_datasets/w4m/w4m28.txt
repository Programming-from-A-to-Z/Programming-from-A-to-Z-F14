i was listening to music .  stretching my legs and raising on to my toes when i turned around and saw you smile .  you were waiting for the downtown q train .  had a black pageboy cap on and the sweetest smile .  had i not been so shy maybe the interaction would have continued longer .  .  .  and maybe you'll see this .  describe me so i know it's you .
