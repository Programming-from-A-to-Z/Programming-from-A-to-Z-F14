that incapacitated guy in a suit across from me making horrible sounds in his sleep and grabbing his face made us meet eyes and laugh .  at one point he was projectile spitting with his eyes closed so i moved .  i asked you what to do and you shrugged .  i told you that if he died or something i wasn't gonna feel bad cause you enabled me to not do anything .  i just moved here two weeks ago .  i got bigger problems than that guy .  you said .  you are hot let's link .
