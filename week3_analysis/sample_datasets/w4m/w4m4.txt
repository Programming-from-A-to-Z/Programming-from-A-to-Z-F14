this is such a long shot .  but you were sitting on the n this morning around 10 am .  and it was stopping at 59 street in brooklyn .  i was waiting at the platform and we locked eyes for a quick second .  i had brown hair and was wearing mostly black .  and you had on a black hat .  red and black plaid shirt .  and long hair for a guy .  you got off a couple of stops after you got up to check the map inside the subway car .    if it's you .  tell me what stop you got off at in manhattan .  or any other details i guess .    sorry if this is weird .  thought i'd give it a shot .
