slightly embarrassed to post this .  but here goes we were on the same manhattanbound b train around 630 pm this evening in brooklyn .  i think you got on at prospect park .  then i got off at 7th avenue .  there was not enough time i was too shy to say anything but wanted to .  you were sitting .  i was standing across from you .  you have a beard .  were carrying one bag plus another smaller camera .  bag .    hope you say hello if you see this .  tell me something i was wearing if you do .  .  .
