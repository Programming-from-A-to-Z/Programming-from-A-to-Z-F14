this is driving me crazy .  so i resort to the internet for help .  .  .   i met you at walter's on thursday sept 4 .  you were very cool guy who bought us all a round of beer .  you sang some great karaoke .  i thought your energy was amazing .  unfortunately .  i was too .  .  .  clueless to do anything at the moment .  i asked you to come back and sing with us again and you answered that you would .  but you live too far out in jersey .  for some reason .  i took that as a no .  but i wish i hadn't .  if the universe helps me find you .  let me know .
