you were biking on union maybe going towards the park .  while i was heaving a chest up the stairs to my apartment .  i was so taken aback by your kindness and offer of help and your great eyes that i choked and said no .   i hope i at least thanked you for stopping .    say yes to going out for ice cream .  i promise there will be no heavy lifting .
