we met on amtrak acela train number 2167 on thursday .   you got on at nyc and looked handsome in your suit .  en route to home outside of philadelphia .  you sat next to me and we chatted virtually non stop to newark where i got off .  i was in a blue vneck shirt and had a bunch of suitcases .   you didn't ask for my number and i was sad .  but then when you waved at me as the train pulled away my heart lurched and i realized i should have just offered it to you .  i think you felt the same way .  that was almost a week ago and you are still stuck in my mind .  i'll know it's you when you tell me what town you live in we talked all about it and why i had so many suitcases we talked about that too i'm sure this is a waste of time but at least i tried .  i'd love to talk more with you .
