we met at a bar on the les late saturday night .  you were tall .  brown hair .  wearing a blazer .  and had some scruff .  i was the tall blonde who helped close out the bar with you and your friend .  the party continued in long island city until i exited quickly in an uber to meet up with my cousin .  wasn't even thinking .  .   if you happen to see this .  would love to see you again even if it means leaving the island .
