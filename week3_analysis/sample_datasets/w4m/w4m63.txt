we rode the r train uptown and into queens .  sitting across from each other in the rather empty first car .  you looked like a bro in sweats .  but i found that attractive .  i was the blonde with red pants .  you got off at steinway .  i kept on for a few more stops .  hit me up if you want to chat or hang sometime .
