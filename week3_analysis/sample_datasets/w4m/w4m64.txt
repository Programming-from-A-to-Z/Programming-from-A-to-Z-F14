we used to date when you lived in tennessee .  .  . last time i checked you lived in the brooklyn area now .  i hope you still do so you can maybe have a chance at seeing this .  i still have feelings for you and i honestly always will .  i know we were young but honestly i was stupid for leaving you .  we could have had something so good .  i honestly saw a future with you .   we have both moved on now .  but obviously something was still there when you asked to hang out before leaving for new york .   if you ever see this .  i just wanted to let you know i wish we didn't leave things unresolved .  i wish things would've worked out .  and if you ever want to talk .  i'm here .
