you were already on the g train this morning when i got on at classon .  we made some eye contact when i got on .  and for some of the ride .  we both transferred to the c at hoyt .  you are very tall .  bespectacled .  bearded .  wearing a red plaid shirt messenger bag .  overall very adorable .   i have brown hair .  sunglasses on my head .  brown jacket .  the glances probably really meant nothing .  but no harm in putting it out into the ether .
