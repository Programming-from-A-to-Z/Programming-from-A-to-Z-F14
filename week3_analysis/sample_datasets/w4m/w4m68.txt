you were tall .  with dak hair and a bright orange shirt .  running north near the area where the softball fields .  turtle pond and the small stadium is located .   i was dressed in a small black leather cropped jacket .  long black flowy dress with long hair .  i was walking next to a red head with a bright pink purse .   we locked eyes for a sec and experienced a moment of intensity in our passing .  .  .   if you happen to find this .  get in touch .
