we met once at the small dog run at carl schurz early this summer after you pointed out that we both owned the same breed .  we realized we lived near one another when we walked alongside each other on our way home .  i was new to the neighborhood .  and you gave me a rundown on good food spots .  especially sushi .    i was hoping you'd ask for my number .  but you never did maybe our goodbye on crowded 1st ave was too quick .  maybe you have a girlfriend .  maybe you overheard me talk about my exboyfriend and thought i said current boyfriend .   anywho .  i am single and think you're adorable .  you have light hair .  a british accent that i thought almost sounded like another country please respond with which country i guessed as a test .  we saw i think each other a while later at the same small dog run .  but i'm southern and am not accustomed to initiating the convo which is why this post is so hard for me .   if you are single and regret the missed connection too .  please respond and describe what my dog and i look like as proof .   hope to hear from you .  finally .
