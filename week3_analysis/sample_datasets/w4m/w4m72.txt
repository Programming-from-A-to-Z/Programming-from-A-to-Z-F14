i miss you .  i wish this feeling of emptiness would disappear but even after months of silence this dark void consumes me .  and it's my fault because i continue to let it sadden me .  maybe it's really all i have to remind me of you .  silence .  memory .  thoughts of what could have been .  i try to understand why we stopped talking .  i was always afraid to ask why .  i would love to hear from you .  just to know that you are well .  in every friendly manner of course .  i am far away .  maybe too far in my mind but one thing i know for certain .  i really do miss you .
