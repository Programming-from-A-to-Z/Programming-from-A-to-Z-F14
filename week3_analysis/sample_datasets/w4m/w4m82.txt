hey mike .  we met on here .  you work on 42st .  you were the first and last guy that i've ever met on here .  you caught my attention .  we went on 1 date .  which i was 2hrs late for and you actually waited for me .  you were soo tired cause you didn't sleep .  but as soon as we hit 14st train station .  you started break dancing with your crew .  you took me to your favorite pizza spot .  which i ended up not liking .  too sweet haha .  then we went to see a movie .  we legit made out through the whole thing .  you were super sensual with the way you kissed and the way you touched me .  i couldn't stop touching your beard .  softest beard ever i swear lolz .  last words to me were tonight was dope .  i have to see you again .   look i know this is weird .  but i just can't get you out of my freaking head .  and believe me i've tried .  i keep trying .  idk i just thought our connection was dope .  i thought you did too .  maybe i'm wrong and you just weren't that into me .  either way .  i miss you .    you probably will never read this .  but if by chance you do .  send me a msg .  let me know your still alive .
