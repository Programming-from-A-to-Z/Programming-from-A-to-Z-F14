i know i'm wasting my time i am never going to find you  .  as of right now all i have is fate to go on and memories of how our eyes met .  if i could go back do that day i should have said something even if it was just hi now since 72714 i have thought about you every day and know i will never see you again .  but if by chance you do see this we were on flight b6 0324 from lax to jfk you were sitting in row 18 i believe seat f  .  i also realize you probably don't feel the same or could be in a relationship but as stupid as it is i haven't given up hope
