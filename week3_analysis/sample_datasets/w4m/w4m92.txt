you were perfectlybalanced the entire time we stood next to each other against the 2 train doors .  around 530 pm today .  each of us moving to the side at a couple of stops to let people on and off .   we caught eyes when you first got on fulton .  chambers .  i can't remember and again one or two times after that .    i also had glasses .  a plaid shirt and messy bangs because rain .  i got off at times square .  and if this winds up on your radar .  let's head to the same place next time .
